This work was done as a class project for MIT 6.882: Embodied Intelligence. Credit is due to Professor Tomas Lozano-Perez for providing valuable feedback on my approach. Credit is also due to a previous replication attempt of the hierarchical-DQN paper, which did not successfully replicate the results but inspired aspects of this implementation: https://github.com/EthanMacdonald/h-DQN
